You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see 
http://support.sas.com/rnd/migration/planning/platform/64bit.html

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

31         *                       DRN OC. Output may be used locally or to facilitate

35         *                       Query Tool (DRN QT). These tables consist of aggregate

43         *                       each request by the DRN OC Data Curation team; the
44         *                       contents of this folder should not be edited.

47         *  Actions needed:
