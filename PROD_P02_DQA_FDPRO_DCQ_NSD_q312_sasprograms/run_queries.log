44         *                2) Each site is required to create the following sub-directory
45         *                   structure on its network/server. The subdirectories must
46         *                   reside within an outer folder which contains the query name
47         *                   from the DRN Query Tool (e.g. PROD_P02_DQA_FDPRO_DCQ_T1D3_r001_v01)
48         *                   a) /dmlocal: folder containing output generated by the
49         *                       request that should be saved locally but not returned to
50         *                       DRN OC. Output may be used locally or to facilitate
51         *                       follow-up queries.
52         *                   b) /drnoc: folder containing output generated by the request
53         *                       that should be returned to the DRN OC via the PCORnet DRN
54         *                       Query Tool (DRN QT). These tables consist of aggregate
55         *                       data/output and transfer the minimum required to answer
56         *                `       the analytic question.
57         *                   c) /sasprograms: folder containing the master SAS program
58         *                       that must be edited and then executed locally.
59         *                       (i.e. RUN_QUERIES.SAS)
60         *                   d) /infolder: folder containing all input and lookup files
61         *                       needed to execute request. Input files are created for
62         *                       each request by the DRN OC Data Curation team; the
63         *                       contents of this folder should not be edited.
64         *                       (i.e. DATA_CURATION_QUERY.SAS)
65         *
66         *  Actions needed:
67         *               1) User provides libname path where data resides (section below)
68         *                     (Example: /ct/pcornet/data/)
69         *               2) User provides root network/server path where the required
70         *                     sub-directory structure has been created (section below)
71         *                     (Example: /ct/pcornet/queries/PROD_P02_DQA_FDPRO_DCQ_T1D3_r001_v01/)
72         *                  ###  DO NOT add sub-directory structure (i.e. /dmlocal) ###
73         *               3) User provides the low cell count value (section below)
74         *                     (Example: 20) (default is 11)
